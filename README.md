Hello. This is my teamgenerator. It was made under duress and I apologize. The testing functionality is not quite where I want it but as of yet you are able to use your terminal to create a team beginning with a Manager. Afterward you can choose between Intern or Engineer each with a specific tag associated with them that will show up in the simple html that will be created post terminal use.
